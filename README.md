# Surf Shop Analysis

## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to compare weather differences between June and December for the island of Oahu.  This will impact our Surf & Shake shop, which we hope to open somewhere on the island.

## Results:
 - Average temperatures in June are 74.9 degrees farenheit vs December at 71.04.  So, on average Decemeber temperatures are colder.
 - Minimum temperatures in June are 64.0 vs December at 56.0 - so, the coldest it gets in December is significantly colder than June.
 - Standard deviation of temperature in June are 3.25 vs December at 3.75.  This is interesting - though the average and minimum temperatures in December are lower than June - the variance in temperature isn't that different.  Meaning, the temperature is about as stable in June as it is in December. 

## Summary:
Just based on temperature, we can see that a surf shop would likely be successful year-round, or at least is not particularly suceptible to inclimate temperatures.  However, since the original concern of the investor was rainfall, it would be necessary to run analyses of precipitation in both June and December, as well as discern which locations on the island have heavier rainfall, as climate in Hawaii can depend heavily on which side of the island you're located.
